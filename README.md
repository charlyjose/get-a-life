# get-a-life

This is not a serious project!!! While I was searching for accommodations in Leicester I came across some good websites (including sulets), so I thought why not make it easier for me to get all the results in a map (it would be more sensible right?). So tried hacking!!!

Thanks to OpenStreetMap. Kudos to its contributers!!!

This app searches for accommodations in https://www.sulets.com/ and compile the results into a json file. It also generates a map.html of the available lettings.
